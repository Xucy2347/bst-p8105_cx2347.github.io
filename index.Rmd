you can do everything you might usually do.

Than means you can add text.

This website is an example coming from [P8105](https://p8105.com/index.html). We' re making websites today! Learn more about this site [here](about.html).

I also use [google](https://www.google.com/) a ton for data science.

# Some plots?
here are some [plots](plots.html). It is amazing to see that you can use the r markdown as usual when you are making the website.
